### Motivation
The transition from a more relaxed lifestyle to the fast-paced environment of university can be challenging for many freshmen. From our experiences, many students struggle with the sudden increase in pace of life, particularly in academically rigorous courses. Often, they are not equipped with the necessary tools to handle their emotions and feelings of being overwhelmed, leading to stress and anxiety.

The transition from a more relaxed lifestyle to the fast-paced environment of university is a significant change for many freshmen. University life is often characterized by demanding coursework, tight schedules, and competing priorities, which can be overwhelming for students who are not used to it. The sudden increase in pace of life can be particularly challenging for students in academically rigorous courses, who may find it difficult to keep up with the demanding workload.

Moreover, many students may not be equipped with the necessary tools to manage their stress and anxiety effectively. They may not have had previous experiences dealing with high-pressure situations or may have relied on different coping mechanisms before entering university. The lack of preparation can exacerbate feelings of being overwhelmed, leading to stress and anxiety.

### Aim
Our aim is to ensure that mental health resources and tools for managing mental health are as easily accessible and user-friendly as possible.

### User Stories
- As a schooling student who is under a lot of stress, having to juggle between assignments, examinations, extracurriculars, and others, I want to be able to have a simple to use platform where I can easily regulate my stress and regain the motivation to continue on.
- As someone struggling with mental health issues, I want to be able to have ready access to sufficient and quality resources to help me tackle them.
- As a student who is experiencing new environments and schedules, I want to have an easy way to pen down my jumbled thoughts to help me understand them more clearly.
- As a student who frequently feels overwhelmed, I would like to take periodic mental breaks to reflect and to take small steps back to reflect and assess my current situation holistically, which will allow me to gain a more positive outlook and cope better with the challenges I face.

### Features and Timeline
We propose the development of a mental health mobile application that will provide users with two essential features to improve their well-being: meditation exercises, and daily affirmations. The app aims to promote self-awareness, mindfulness, and positivity in users.

The first feature, meditation exercises, will offer users guided meditation practices that are designed to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The app will provide a range of meditation sessions that cater to different needs and preferences. Users can choose from a variety of guided meditations, including mindfulness or breathing exercises.

The second feature, daily affirmations, will provide users with positive messages that they can use to start their day on a positive note. The app will offer a selection of affirmations that users can choose from, and they can customize their own affirmations if they prefer. This will help users to boost their self esteem, as well as reducing their stress and anxiety levels.

The meditation exercises and daily affirmations are to be implemented maximally by mid June, such that we can dedicate July to any further possible additions in features, or debugging and refining of the application. In the last few weeks up until the deadline, we intend to connect our application to a database which allows users to sign up and log in to track their activity.

### How are we different from similar platforms?

- Format and Flow of application

  - We aim to make our app as simple as possible to use, with a streamlined and linear flow that prevents overwhelming users with information. By prioritizing user experience, we ensure that navigating our app feels intuitive and effortless, allowing you to focus on your journey towards inner balance and serenity. 

- Choice of mindfulness activities

  - Our unique combination of guided breathing exercises, daily affirmations along with a supportive community, creates a harmonious and user-friendly space for the user’s mental wellbeing needs.
